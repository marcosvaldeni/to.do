# :memo: Description
This project is not a standard boilerplate template create with the command `npx create-react-app`.  Everything in here was set from the very beginning, in order for us to understand how the Library React works behind the curtain. All the lines of setting on `babel.config.js`, `webpack.config.js` and `tsconfig.json` were set by hand.
